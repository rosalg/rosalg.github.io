      Hi! My name is Gilbert Rosal and I'm a student at Stanford majoring in Computer Science
      with a focus in Artificial Intelligence.
      <br><br>
      I love designing games and websites with the intention of helping people, whether it be
      through skills training, providing a fun outlet, or staying connected with those who matter most.

        This program sheet helps Stanford students planning to enter A.I. plan the classes they will take through their
        four years at Stanford. The website was drafted on behalf of Stanford as they were looking for a better way
        for students to develop their 4-year plans.<br>
        <br>
        The website uses a drag and drop interface that informs students of any incomplete prerequisites when a class
        is selected, any classes that follow a planned class, any classes the student gets credit for from AP/IB tests,
        and any outstanding degree requirements. Users click the selector, select a class, and can then drag that class
        into the available time based on whether it is offered and whether all prerequisites have been satisfied.

        In a group of 3, we designed an explorable explainer to help users clarify the dichotomy between the environment
        and the economy. More often than not, these two things are seen as opposite ends of a spectrum and with this
        explainer, we hope to debunk that myth to show that the two can mutually coexist.<br>
        <br>
        As users select different policies, they can see the percent change each policy has on different factors. These
        percent changes are based on research referenced in the larger <a href="https://medium.com/design-for-understanding-cs-247i-fall-2019/climate-and-the-economy-470d5c4278c9">

        Following the development of EVE, my group and I developed a website titled "The Economics of Climate Change" or
        ECC for short. This website's goal was to further break the perceived dichotomy between the environment and economy.
        This website equips users with tools to see research and news to break the myth, followed by opportunities to take action afterwards.<br>
        <br>
        The write-up explains the design steps that were taken to create the website including our content strategy and
        message architecture break downs. It also includes a review of preliminary research that looked at an average
        user's mental model of our topic to generate intuitive navigation links.<br>

          Blueshot is a 2-player cooperative game where players can connect over the internet to battle incoming waves
          of enemies. Each player can either see the color of an enemy (red, green, blue) or cannot see the color. If
          the player cannot see the color, then that enemy is trying to kill them. That player must kill the enemy
          before it reaches them by shooting it with the correct color. The teammate is the player who can see the
          enemies color. Using a ping, the teammate must then communicate to the player being chased what color the
          enemy is. <br>
          <br>
          This game was the final project for the class "Neuroplasticity and Musical Gaming". The game's goal is to
          train users in two important skills: empathizing and low-level object formation. Firstly, by forcing users to experience
          running and communicating, we hope to generate a better ability to empathize with struggle. Secondly, by creating
          an association between sound and object, we hope to improve the response of brain cells that attach meaning to sound.<br>
          <br>
          The game was made using Unity in a group of 4, with version control handled through Unity. I was in charge of
          managing enemies, audio (both production and scripting), and bug-fixing networking issues.

          Super CS107E is a 2-player fighting game that draws heavy inspiration from Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers.
          In this game, each player selects a character then must fight the other until they deplete their opponent's
          health bar. <br>
          <br>
          It was made in a group of two in a Unix command line with version control managed through Github.
          The game was made from scratch on a Raspberry Pi using a self-made graphics library in C. The game uses
          Gamecube Remotes as the players' controllers with scripts made in C and assembly. <br>
          <br>
          The code for the game is available <a href="https://github.com/rosalg/projects/tree/master/SuperSmashCS107E">here</a>.

        Coin: A Tale of Two Sides is a self-made single-player puzzle game available on the
        <a id="appstorelink" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin-a-tale-of-two-sides/id1506452163">iOS app store</a> for free.
        Users are confronted with the challenge of bringing both characters to the exit <span style="font-weight:bold;">at the same time</span>.
        The difficulty lies in the character movement and stage layout: whenever one character moves, the other must move as well, forcing users
        to think about how the actions of one can affect the other's ability to reach the exit. Users move the characters by dragging
        the joystick on the left to move left and right and the button on the right to jump. <br>
        <br>
        The game was made using Unity and all music, sound effects, and artwork were made by myself. Unity was self taught. <br>
        <br>
        I also made this game with the intention of it being a serious game that makes commentary through subtext and
        a user's puzzle solving process. This is because the user must consider both character's perspectives to reach
        some common goal. Through this subtle communication, I aim to improve users' empathy and ability to communicate
        with people of differing perspectives.<br>
        <br>
        The code for the game is available <a href="https://github.com/rosalg/projects/tree/master/Coin/Assets/Scripts">here</a>.
